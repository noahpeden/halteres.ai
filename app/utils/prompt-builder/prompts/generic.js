For the program description, include:
1. A concise overview of the program's goals and intended adaptations
2. The periodization approach used and why it's appropriate
3. Expected outcomes from following the program
4. Recommendations for nutrition, recovery, and supplementary training

Program Requirements:
- Design a well-balanced training program with appropriate progression
- Include a mix of strength, conditioning, and mobility work
- Focus on compound functional movements
- Ensure proper warm-up and cool-down protocols
- Include specific coaching cues for technical movements
- Balance intensity and recovery throughout the program

The program should follow logical progression based on the selected program type (${programType}).
Ensure proper periodization, recovery, and exercise variation throughout the program.

IMPORTANT: The workouts must be scheduled on specific dates according to the user's selected training days. DO NOT create workouts on days other than the ones specified.

Your response MUST be in this exact JSON format:
{
  "title": "Training Program for ${goal}",
  "description": "A comprehensive ${numberOfWeeks}-week ${difficulty} program focused on ${
    focus_area || goal
  } that includes detailed weekly progression, nutrition guidance, and recovery recommendations",
  "overview": "A detailed explanation of the program methodology, periodization approach, expected outcomes, and supplementary recommendations",
  "workouts": [
    {
      "title": "Week X, Day Y: [Focus Area] and [Training Focus]",
      "body": "Detailed workout description including all required sections",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    },
    ...more workouts
  ]
}

For each workout's "body" field, use this structure:
\`\`\`
