For the program description, include:
1. A concise overview of the program's goals and intended adaptations
2. The periodization approach used and why it's appropriate for a commercial gym setting
3. Expected outcomes from following the program
4. Recommendations for nutrition, recovery, and supplementary training

Commercial Gym-Specific Requirements:
- Include traditional bodybuilding-style training with appropriate isolation and compound movements
- Incorporate machine work, free weights, and cable exercises
- Design muscle group splits that optimize recovery (push/pull, upper/lower, body part splits)
- Emphasize progressive overload with specific rep schemes and percentage-based loading
- Include targeted hypertrophy, strength, and/or endurance protocols based on the goal
- Incorporate appropriate rest periods and superset structures

The program should follow logical progression based on the selected program type (${programType}).
Ensure proper periodization, recovery, and exercise variation throughout the program.

IMPORTANT: The workouts must be scheduled on specific dates according to the user's selected training days. DO NOT create workouts on days other than the ones specified.

Your response MUST be in this exact JSON format:
{
  "title": "Gym Training Program for ${goal}",
  "description": "A comprehensive ${numberOfWeeks}-week ${difficulty} commercial gym program focused on ${
    focus_area || goal
  } that includes detailed weekly progression, nutrition guidance, and recovery recommendations",
  "overview": "A detailed explanation of the program methodology, periodization approach, expected outcomes, and supplementary recommendations",
  "workouts": [
    {
      "title": "Week X, Day Y: [Muscle Groups] and [Training Focus]",
      "body": "Detailed workout description including all required sections",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    },
    ...more workouts
  ]
}

For each workout's "body" field, use this structure:
\`\`\`
## Stimulus and Strategy
[Detailed explanation of workout stimulus and strategy approach]
- Explain the intended stimulus for each movement and muscle group
- Provide pacing guidance and rest periods
- Explain how to approach the workout (e.g., "Focus on mind-muscle connection for the isolation movements")

${
  includeScaling
    ? `## Scaling Options
### Intermediate Option
[Detailed intermediate scaling with specific weights and modifications]

[Detailed beginner scaling with specific weights and modifications]
${
  hasInjuryHistory
    ? `
### Injury Considerations
[Modifications for common limitations]`
    : ''
}`
    : ''
}

## Warm-up
[Detailed warm-up protocol with specific movements, sets, reps]
- Include duration, reps, and brief explanations
- Focus on movement preparation and activation for target muscle groups

## Strength Work
[Complete strength workout with movements, sets, reps, specific weights]
- Clear exercise format (Sets x Reps)
- Specific movements, sets, reps, and rest periods
- Exact weights or percentage-based loading
- Tempo prescriptions where appropriate (e.g., "3-1-2-0 tempo")

## Conditioning/Accessory Work
[Accessory exercises or conditioning work]
- Clear exercise format
- Specific movements, sets, reps, and rest periods
- Target muscle groups and intended stimulus

## Cool-down
[Detailed cool-down protocol]
- Include specific movements and durations
- Focus on recovery and mobility work

## Coaching Cues
[3-5 specific technical cues for key movements]
- Technical cues for the most complex movements
- Form tips to maximize efficiency and safety
- Common errors to avoid
\`\`\`

The "workouts" array should contain exactly ${totalWorkouts} workouts, organized in a progressive sequence.

${

IMPORTANT: Each workout MUST be assigned to one of the above dates. These dates strictly follow the user's selected training days of the week.`
