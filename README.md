This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Vercel Timeout Configuration

For program generation endpoints that might take longer than the default Vercel timeout (10 seconds), the following configurations have been implemented:

1. `vercel.json` includes a `maxDuration` setting of 300 seconds (5 minutes) for the `/api/generate-program` routes
2. Each API route has an exported `maxDuration = 300` setting
3. The Next.js configuration includes HTTP headers to maintain connections for longer periods
4. Client-side retry logic with exponential backoff has been implemented to handle potential timeouts

When deploying to Vercel, these settings will allow the AI program generation to take up to 5 minutes to complete, which should be sufficient for most complex program generations.
